## System Workflow

1. A user fills out a **Pet Submission Form**, optionally uploading a picture of the pet.
2. The pet‚Äôs data is stored in the database, and the request appears in the **Admin Panel - Requested Pet List**.
3. An **Admin** assigns a **Doctor** to examine the pet.
4. The **Doctor physically inspects** the pet and updates the health status (Approve or Reject).
5. Once approved, the pet moves into the **Adoptable Pets List** and becomes visible to the public.
6. Admins can manage the pet‚Äôs **profile, add medical bills**, or edit any details.
7. Additionally, pets can also be added directly by admins without user submission, for cases when pets are brought in manually.

### Role-Based Login Flow

- A single login form is used by both Users and Admins.
- After login:
  - **Users** are directed to a pet submission form where they can offer pets for adoption or protection.
  - **Admins** are directed to the Admin Panel to manage the system (pet approvals, doctor assignments, etc.).
